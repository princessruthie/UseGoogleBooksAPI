# UseGoogleBooksAPI  

Udacity Android Basics Nanodegree Project Number 7.  An app that uses the Books api to search book titles for a given term.  

This project is not actively maintained.  If you're looking for a canonical starter app, look in the google training app.  If you're looking for a sample of my work, maybe look at the [Popular Movies projects](https://github.com/princessruthie/Popular-Movies-Stage-2).
